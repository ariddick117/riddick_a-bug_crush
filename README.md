# Homework 3: Bug Crush

Using the in-class build files for the Drag n' Drop example, find and fix the bugs that we discovered in class.

## Description

Working with the existing Drag N Drop game with the puzzle pieces, I am working to fix the two main bugs that have arisen.

* Bug One: When two pieces are dropped into the same space, the second piece disappears and cannot be recovered without resetting the game entirely. This poses a problem as the pieces do not reset if placed incorrectly.
* Bug Two: When the images at the bottom are clicked to change puzzles, the image and pieces change as planned. However, if a puzzle attempt was already made, the pieces within the board will change as well. The idea behind this is to reset the board and the pieces back to their original spaces.
